Finally, settled in Chicago, he petitioned us all and we came in the summer of 2003. I remember being a four year old child, at the airport sobbing that I wanted to stay. I did not know how to speak, read, nor write in English, so going to school was difficult. I eventually adapted to American norms and finally finished ESL classes in 4th grades. I could not imagine being anywhere else surrounded by anyone else. Through living in Chicago and attending Lane Tech, I have met many of my best friends and others with similar stories to mine. It has opened my eyes to countless stories and diversity. "

Although this is such a major improvement from his life in Mexico, the struggles and worries are not over with. Everyday I am worried. \"Me paro la policia.\" I was pulled over by the police, he tells us at the dinner table. I am worried that one day, my dad will not come home from work. I am worried that I won't open the door at 6:00 pm and give my dad a warm hug anymore. I am scared that the life he built for himself will come crashing down one day. I am all for the security of our country, but not when it comes down to separating people from their loving families. People who obey the laws, and work hard for what they have. Many people come to America to create a better for themselves. Everyone should have the right to care for their family, work hard, and be respected. "

      "Detail" : "Having a Quincenera is every  Mexican 15 year old’s dream! But not this 15 year old, she wanted to achieve the “American Dream”. My mother crossed the border with her niece coming from Michoacan, Mexico. She sacrificed everything to get to the other side, to have a job that would at least pay her minimum wage. When they crossed the border there was a group of 20 people, all from different ages but the with the same purpose. They began to walk, nights and days without any rest or food but they had each other to stay close together in a herd to keep eachother warm. There was nights where it would rain all night and all they could do was keep on walking while letting the rain cry onto them. For them, there seemed to never be an end. The coyote’s job was to take them to a little house and there was a truck waiting for them, where it would lay the people on the ground of the truck like sausages, in order for them to cross the border to California. But the journey to the little house had many obstacles, such as crossing the river. My mother was too afraid to look. When she crossed all she could hear was the water crashing into the rocks. Once crossing, she turned back and thought to herself, “Dios mío, si alguien se cae, se mueren.” Another problem was when the group decided to take a rest. They all ended up falling asleep till one of them yelled, “La Migra!”, they all woke up and scattered like rats to hide into bushes or behind them. This is where my mother lost my cousin. My cousin started yelling for my mother, but the people my mom was hiding with didn’t allow her to yell back. Her heart was pounding because she thought they caught my cousin, but they didn’t. As soon as the immigration force left, there was only six survivors left. Six out of the 20.. “Nunca jamás lo aria”, my mother tells me."

She and her parents (Borach and Raizel) fled Russia in 1926 because the Bolsheviks were persecuting Jews.  When the boat they were on was turned away from the United Stated because Jews weren't being accepted, they were sent to Havana, Cuba. In 1935, Rachel and her mother (and now her younger brother, Gerson) purchased fake passports to sneak into the United States.  They traveled as the Corbelles family: Rachel became Nilda, her mother became Rose, and Gerson became Victor.  Borach looked \"too Jewish\", so he traveled on the bottom of the boat where he was covered with the coal.  They were in the United States for more than a year when they were found out and deported back to Cuba.  In 1938, the family was granted legal entry into the United States.  Because her family and friends in the United States knew her as Nilda, she continued to use that name for the rest of her life."

She was very homesick and preoccupied with her future as a single mom living in an unknown country. Unfortunately, a few months later, my mom got news that her mother died of cancer in Poland. With a 5-month-old baby in her arms and no money for a ticket back home, my mom went through a very tough time in the early months of her settlement in the US. Luckily, life got better for my mom. She eventually moved to Chicago and lived in a predominantly Polish neighborhood. She calls Chicago her \"home away from home\". Surrounded by her peers and her native language, my mom was able to overcome her grief and raise me in the culture that she loves. To this day, my mom and I perform in Polish Folk Groups and I can credit my mom for teaching me Polish songs, literature, music, culture, and most importantly, the Polish language."

I don't remember much of what occurred before, but one of the only memories I have is that of bidding farewell to my grandmother in Honduras, followed by a long tear-filled car ride. While, I don't quite remember all the details, it sounds like something I rather not relive. Once in the U.S., life was difficult, but it was the only one I knew. Coming into this country speaking no English whatsoever with few friends to look towards for help, I had to quickly adjust to the new reality of needing to learn the language. That in of itself was a challenge due to the complexity of the English language. However, like now, I became a social learner, thriving off experiences with others and taking every interaction as a way to learn.  This country is all I know, it is my home. My parents came in search of a better life, and I want the opportunity to give it to them. This nation was built on the backs of immigrants, and a closed minded mentality of the few that threaten the stability of the whole country."

As soon as her school day ended, she'd go and work with her siblings and her dad at their family company. That was her life for a while, or until she was about 16. When she was 16, she realized that her life was not how she wanted. She wanted to have fun and explore outside of her comfort zone. In her home, it was very difficult to do so because her father would not let her do anything except school and work. So one day, she went to work and told her brother that she was going to the washroom. The washroom just ended up being in another country. Through the hardships of finding ways to finally get to the new country, she called home and told everyone. Of course, everyone was worried sick and her father was angry, but she was filled with determination. She got here from way down south and ended up in Chicago where she has been living ever since. She already had two children in Mexico (early pregnancies) and today, she has a total of 8 children, numerous jobs, and her official citizenship. She works morning shifts at one job, then a mid shift, and a closing shift at other places. So, she works all day every day and is sleep deprived. But you know why? She bought a home for herself and family, she bought a car, and her older kids have graduated from college/ university, married, and living a successful life. She came here in mind to create a better life for herself, but even when obstacles, like kids, she made even better lives for them too. It was all to give them everything she never had when she was younger, and she did it. Immigrants do not come here to disturb the atmosphere of the U.S., but instead they make it better. The U.S. should not close their doors because of stereotypical rumors, but focus on how they make everything better. And oh yeah, that woman is my mom. "

The youngest sister (1 year old) stayed with their paternal grandmother. The family had to be split apart to make things easier. When her parents decided to bring them to Chicago, my grandmother went to get them but my mother cannot recall how she arrived the first time. Her and her family returned to Mexico shortly after because their grandfather became very ill. When the family decided to go back the second time, it was a more vivid experience. She traveled with her mom and sisters and two other mothers along with their own children. Getting close to the border they split up into groups. My mother got to travel with her cousin and a younger boy. Upon arriving close to the border the lady that crossed them in a old station wagon told the children to go to sleep otherwise the chamuco, or “demon”, would get them. So scared, the children actually did fall asleep. Now, finally in the States, they arrived at an unknown house, where eventually everyone was reunited again. The rest of the road trip to Chicago was long and very hot. My mom celebrated her 6th birthday on that car ride. Once in Chicago, their parents registered the girls in a catholic school. My mother started kindergarten with Ms. Smith who only knew one word in spanish– “comprende?” They sat her next to a girl named Ana, because she was hispanic. There were no bilingual programs and the girls were thrown into the fire. Fortunately, they picked it up quickly and soon enough became their parents official interpreters for everything, which is no easy task for a young child. That is how my mother immigrated to America."

When Trump was elected, I became permanently afraid for not only my own safety and status, but his as well. It feels like every time I see him, we've just got a timer counting down to when I can't see him. He has DACA, but with the possibility of reform and the lack of a direct path to citizenship from DACA, my fear only grows daily. However, from that fear, has come endless bounds of love and taught me appreciation for his impact in my life, from \"Did you get home safely?\" texts, to late night conversations, to overwhelming gratitude for him everyday he is alive. Fear has taught me how to love a friend and just how important he is to me. While none of this changes his status, this drives me everyday to do everything I can in my will to figure out a path to citizenship. On DACA, he can't leave the country; but I've vowed to help him get citizenship, and the dream is that one day we will be able to leave this country and return, welcomed with open arms. "

It was hard. I was changing jobs until I found my now husband at one of them. From there he made my life more consistent. Every now and then I send my family in Mexico money but I feel it's not enough and I just think that my life in Mexico was good and it was pointless in coming to Chicago.

When I was about 4 years old, my parents decided that it was time for the family to reunite. I was only 4, I thought that we were making a small trip to meet with my dad and that we would be back in no time. But little did I know that 14 years later, I would still be here. It's been so much time since I've last seen my grandparents, and I think that's the hardest part of all. I lived so many amazing memories with them, they were like my second grandparents and I miss them so much. Living with the fear and uncertainty if I will get to see them again is the worst feeling ever. Growing up in Chicago was not so bad. I was able to pick up the language pretty fast, and school has been really good, with good grades all the time and nothing but good comments from all my teachers. I've always put a lot of effort when it comes to school, because I have it twice as hard as other students that were born in the USA. I don't have as many opportunities when it comes to scholarships, jobs, or any of those usual things. I also come from a low-income family, so that also piles on to the situation. I can't say this whole experience has been horrible. I have met so many people along the way, so many doors have opened up for me, and yes I am challenged everyday, but those challenges only bring out the best of me. At Lane Tech, I have met many other dreamers, and that honestly has been a blessing because it lets me know that I am not alone. I will be off to college in a few months, and I can not wait to see what it has in stock for me. I am an Immigrant, I am a Dreamer and I will not give up. Si Se Puede!"

      "Detail" : "I immigrated from Cuba when I was 2 years old, now as much as I don't know about my people or culture my family definitely did suffer. When Americans look at Cuba they think \"Communist scum\", it was heartbreaking to say the least because my family wasn't a part of what Fidel Castro wanted. Before we left Cuba, my family was living off small payments from the government that would barely feed us, my father would sometimes go onto the plantations in the middle of the night to buy more food because I was just born and the doctor said I was lighter than the average baby. My father didn't get a high education and although my mother did, it didn't matter because she had 2 children to take care of at home. My father worked at a soap factory and would sneak out soap because we lacked the hygiene products at home and my father wanted the best for his step-daughter and me. We left Cuba not by the typical raft method that everyone talks about. We left through plane, Castro feared a revolution against him so he allowed Cubans to leave the country if they were not patriotic toward his cause. My grandfather spat at the image of Castro everyday, saying that his mother was a kind old woman and he was the devil reincarnate. My grandpa worked as a barber and any soldier, student, and police officer was required to have a regulation haircut, ones that he did not feel comfortable doing. Castro's hatred for gays struck my uncle down and my uncle never went to University, he ended up becoming a pharmacist for the province of Villa Clara. After my family left, including my father, mother, sister, and grandfather, we came to Chicago where our 2nd and 3rd cousins lived. We would visit frequently and send money over, something that we would have to hide in luggage and parcels. Every time we go back we ask for the rest of our family to leave but before Castro's death everyone was under close watch of the police and would not be allowed to even visit the airport. Fidel Castro's reign was terrible and will always leave a scar. I might not have lived through the terror, but I will surely remember it."

      "Detail" : "Peter Urig Sr. was born in Bavaria in 1818. In 1849 Peter, his wife Catharina (also Bavarian), and their baby daughter boarded a ship to America.  The young family settled in the Northern Ohio town of Avon, a primarily German community that was popular with farmers for its rich soil.  Peter was able to buy five plots of land, which he farmed with the help of his sons, and eventually their sons as well.  His youngest son, Henry, inherited some of the farmland, built a homestead, and started a family with Catherine Kelling – also of German descent.  Together, Henry and Catherine raised seven children in a German and English-speaking home.  Their youngest son, Francis, married Jenny Winter and received a plot of land on the Winter homestead.  Francis, however, decided to work in the steel industry rather than continue to farm as his family had done before.  Francis and Jenny’s middle son, Elmer, is my grandpa.  Although he grew up on the family farm, Elmer chose to pursue higher education, being the first in his family to graduate from college.  After serving in WWII, he earned a degree in Chemistry from Miami University of Ohio on the GI Bill and eventually went on to work as a chemist for BF Goodrich, where he helped to invent latex – his name is on the patents!  Elmer married Marylou Brehm – also of German descent – and together they raised five children, the oldest of whom (Linda) is my mother.  She is also the first to settle outside Northern Ohio and the first to marry outside of the German community (my dad is of French descent).  However, she will eventually return to the homestead and be the fifth generation to be buried in one of Avon’s Catholic cemeteries.  From my ancestors, I have learned the value of hard-work, education, and family.  I have learned dedication.  I have learned to help others and to be proud of what I have worked for and appreciate where I came from.  I am Katharine (Urig) Laroche, a fifth-generation American."

I didn't know that I was so different from them because from what I saw we were all the same color and all breathed the same air but they made it a goal to point out differences. Luckily, we were all still young and younger children area little more forgiving but I went through my fair share of \"Go back to Africa\" and \"African booty scratcher\" and the funniest of them all, kids making random clicking sounds and noises then asking me to translate the gibberish. Regardless, I found friendships and made a family that I was sad to leave come 8th grade.\r I'm not sure what opportunities I would have had if I stayed in Nigeria.

      "Detail" : "My grandmother throughout my life has always told me that when she lived in Belgium she really felt at home and secure. She grew up in this small village on the outskirts of Brussels where she lived until she was about 20 years old. One day she went to Brussels and this is where her life changed forever because this is where she met Edward (my grandfather/her husband). She always mentioned that it was love at first site. However, things turned for the worst when she got married when she was 19 years old. Edward wanted to move to America to live the American dream, but she wanted to remain in Belgium where she knew how to live and where she knew basically everyone. She described it to me that she was \"dragged to America in chains.\" She always tells me she wonders why so many people make a big deal about America. For example, she doesn't see anything special about the Statue of Liberty. To be honest, she felt scared the first couple of years that she lived here making her think: \"Is this really the American Dream?\" She was frightened because she never really saw people of different races, cultures, or backgrounds. She has always been with \"her kind\" of people. Also, she said the ways things operate in America is completely different than they way things are done in Belgium. She couldn't believe it that people had to go the grocery store to buy eggs and milk. Not to mention the fact that she didn't know how to speak fluent English at this time, which made it even more difficult for here. The one thing that she always tells me is that if it was up to her they would have stayed in Belgium, which blows my mind because I can't imagine how different our family would be if that had happened. Overall, she was not happy that she came to America because she lost her \"old\" family, but she is happy today because she still has part of her family with her, including me."

My grandpa would go to California to work in fields, and send money to his family, and my grandma was responsible for taking care of the kids. Once my mom was in 6th grade, she left school in order to help my grandma take care of her siblings. My grandpa was very strict on my aunts and uncles growing up so when there was an opportunity to go out he wouldn't let them. My mom was tired of living with barely anything to eat, having to make her own clothes, and sharing a bed with her siblings. So when she was about 23 she and her cousin hired a coyote to help them cross the border. Here they were reunited with other family members in Chicago. My mom managed to find a job at a factory but, continued to struggle with living with family members that she hardly knew and not having enough money for herself, and to send back to Mexico. My mom struggled a lot in order to give me a better life."

Instead of coming all the way with them, the coyote dropped the group off at the river and told them to cross quickly, there was no time to waste and it would only be about 10 minutes before border patrol would drive around. She had never learned how to swim, and instead of the river being at a low level as had been promised, there were spots that she had to tip-toe so that the water would not go above her chin.

Which is why it absolutely vexes me when ignorant individuals insist that undocumented people should just \"become legal,\" as if it's a task that can be done as easily as grocery shopping. That's not true at all. In my own family, I was separated from my own parents for five years. My aunt was our sole provider for those years, working multiple jobs a day to be able to provide for my brother and I. Compared to other immigrant families, I consider my family fortunate because more often than not, legalization can take up to a decade or more. That time was certainly trying, a test of character and faith. It's the time I learned more than I think I could in a lifetime. Being an immigrant is a blessing. It's provided me with a rich fusion of two completely different cultures that I can be proud of. It's also taught me the importance of perseverance, to keep moving forward despite facing what seems to be the impossible. It's taught me that success and accomplishment aren't just handed over, but are results of a fighting spirit. This being said, immigrants should not be ostracized, should not be referred to as \"aliens\" or \"illegals,\" but should be regarded as some of the strongest and most resilient people in this country.

When they got to Mexico, a coyote helped them cross the border to Texas. It was a frightening experience for Alicia because she didn't know what was going to happen to her or her family. It became even more frightening when they were detained and interrogated by US Immigration. Their purpose for entering the US was eventually verified by US Immigration and her mom had to pay a fee to continue their travels to Chicago to meet up with Alicia’s aunt. Her mom had no money so they were sent to a refugee camp. They spent about two months there and they were able to leave once her mom had received money from a family member to pay off the fee. They were then able to come to Chicago and they lived with Alicia’s aunt for a few years. When they arrived in Chicago, Alicia's mom did everything by law to become legal including getting Alicia and her siblings enrolled in school. Alicia's first year in school was very difficult because she didn't know how to speak English. She had no way of communicating with her peers or her teachers. She had to work harder than the other kids in her class. Watching cartoons in English helped Alicia learn how to speak English. The most difficult part for Alicia was leaving her aunts and uncles and cousins behind. -Jasmin Reyes  (the picture is a picture of Alicia (on right) and the lady that used to babysit her when she was a child)"

His dad, a member of three different armies during WWII, and his mother, abandoned in Poland after nearly dying, moved to Canada before my dad was born. While in Canada, Ged and his sister were born. At the age of four, my dad’s parents received a sponsorship to move to the United States. He remembers arriving at night to a close family friend’s house after driving for hours. Ged also did not speak very much English despite living in a mostly English speaking country. This meant he had to learn how to speak English in school the following spring. Learning English was not incredibly difficult considering he went to a school with many other Lithuanian people. Ged’s move to the United States was not necessarily the hardest, but definitely was challenging and shaped who he is today. "

My mom told me that moving to the United States was a big adjustment. They came knowing no english whatsoever and my mom learned English from watching the news. To this day, people tell me my mom still has an accent, but I don't hear it, probably because she is my mom. "

She had to learn a new language, find a job despite having high school as her highest education level, and live in a country that was completely foreign and different from the one she grew up in. She was introduced to a BIG culture shock, and despite all that, she was able to get a job, finish college, and become such a great role model for me. My mom went through various struggles in order to migrate to America and she believes it was one of her best decisions made.

My father came in a car with three other close friends nearly thirty years ago, leaving behind his family and friends in search of a better life.

My mother arrived in Arizona nearly half a year later with her aunt. They had both traveled on a train, also illegally. After that my parents both lived with friends until they finally married in 1990. They had my oldest sister three years later. It's a long process to obtain citizenship. First you must be a legal resident for years without any crime convictions. Then several years later you finally gain citizenship. My dad obtained his citizenship around 1998 because he was working under a state law, especially made for immigrants. My mother, however, didn't get hers until about 2004. Nearly thirteen years later they are proud business owners with four daughters and a life that they are immensely grateful for."

Once they earned enough money to pay smugglers to assist them. They took a bus to Piedras Negras, a border town in north Mexico. Then they hiked to the border. They jumped a fence, and were robbed before being left by the smugglers that brought them there. They instructed them from that midpoint to jump a second fence, run across a six lane highway, and sprint the rest of the distance to a nearby McDonald’s, where the second pair of smugglers would pick them up. Once they reached the restaurant, the smugglers drove them to a stash house. The next day, they were given new clothes, and were driven to an airport in Phoenix to fly on a plane to Chicago. It was Mid October, and with barely any money or clothes, the family was very cold. They took a taxi to the house where the father was. And so marked the next chapter in her life."

America is very scary for someone who doesn't know the language or the culture. Even the simplest things can be challenging such as putting oil in your car, going to the laundromat, and transportation. Jobs here are also different than those back in the person's home country. When my mom got to the United States she had to get a job in a factory and she was always living in fear of being deported due to her not living in the United States legally. Due to that her daily routine was work, home and back again. She couldn't rest, if she did it would make her paranoid. This is the life of an immigrant who comes to America for a better life for her and her family. Yet that is wrong for some people who say they could have come here legally but don't know that the process takes years to do, especially in recent years because more laws have been directly affecting these immigrants. My mom has adjusted to life here in America. She is well and happy to be here because now her children have a better education and can have careers. "

Finally they reached Arizona where they were picked up and they left for Chicago. Since my mom arrived to the US, there has not been a time when she was unemployed. For almost 25 years she has been working in any kind of factory you can think of. From working in Tyson's Chicken factory to making the croissants that are used in Burger King. Having raised me and my 2 siblings there hasn't been a day that she hasn't struggled. She would drop off me and my siblings to go to work for sometimes 50 hours a week.

When she first came to the United States my mom had nothing, and still she continues to work hard. So much that she even managed to buy a house for our family 2 years ago.

It was my version of reality. This reality was soon shattered—my family made the decision to come to the United States, which meant it was time to say goodbye to my home.At five years old, I did not fully understand what “moving” really meant. I did not understand that the United States was a country in a completely different continent, which meant I was leaving behind all my friends and many family members. When it was time to leave my beautiful country, I did not know that I would not be able to come back, until many years later. The U.S. greeted me with a bitter cold wind. As I left the airport, I knew I had arrived to a different planet. The Andes Mountains were nowhere in sight. All I saw was a land covered in “white soil.” But the land was not the only thing that greeted me coldly. The people of this country were so different than the people I was exposed to growing up. Here, people regarded me as another rat in the Latino infestation. At that point I was beginning to understand that I did not fit into this alien society. I wish that I could say that the transition to studying in America was easy, but unfortunately that was the hardest part in terms of adjusting to life in America. I did not know a single word of the strange language the inhabitants of this land used. The first day of school I cried and clung to my parents. For the remainder of the school year all I did was keep quiet, dumbing myself down to fit society's expectations. After realizing that I was not succeeding in my education, I knew it was time to change my habits. My parents were able to put me into bilingual classes to be slowly exposed to the English language. They would spend hours translating every word on my assignments to help me prevail. At an early age I was known as the “bilingual kid” or “the foreigner.”  People did not believe I could ever become successful."

While I don't remember many things from my childhood I do remember my parents working 12 hour shifts daily for about two years before they finally began taking weekends off. I remember the unsanitary conditions the nine of us were forced to live in while everyone got up on their feet. Growing up, me and my sister never wore brand name clothes or had more than two pairs of shoes, but we were always provided with food, shelter, and education. At the age of nine, when my twin sisters came around, I was forced to take care of them everyday after school because for my parents taking a break off work wasn't an option. Our life has been full of complications but in the end all the sacrifices each of us have had to make have been worth it, and while none of us have been able to fix our legal status, today we can happily say we own a house, and my sister will soon be graduating college."
